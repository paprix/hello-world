# hello-world

Hi everybody!

I have some experience in the field of testing websites. I recently took the course "Basics of Software Testing."
Now I want to improve my knowledge with the help of your courses, gain experience in testing, and then get a job for you in the position of QA Engineer and successfully use the gained experience and knowledge :)
